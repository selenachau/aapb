Which he says will lift off the economy within a decade. He then turns to talking about planet heating and how it is getting hotter and hotter. He wants to replace everything that hurts the climate with climate emission responsible products, including heaters and cars. He continues to speak about temperature change and how it effects the globe and how it can affect the economy in the decades to come. Says that some politicians tried to use science to convince older and less educated people that climate change was not true. Says that outside of the U.S. there is little to no debate on climate change. He talks about the U.S. pulled out of Kyoto Accord when Bush took office because they did not see it as fair to first world countries. His dad originally signed the agreement. Believes the time is right to try and reduce climate change, says we have all the allies we need but the time to act is rapidly decreasing and we need to act fast.
